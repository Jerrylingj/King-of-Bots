# King-of-Bots
A two-player turn-based code-editable battle game

The project is divided into two main components:

1. **Web**: Handles the front-end, responsible for displaying web pages.
2. **Backendcloud**: Manages the back-end logic of the game, composed of three microservices:
   - **backend**: Core logic and database interactions.
   - **matchingsystem**: Handles player matching.
   - **botrunningsystem**: Manages bot interactions and operations.
